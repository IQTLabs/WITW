# Where in the World
## Verifying the Geographic Location of Outdoor Images

The *Where in the World* (WITW) project has developed tools and capabilities for cross-view image geolocalization (CVIG).  CVIG is the process of matching a ground-level outdoor photograph to its location using overhead imagery of potential locations as the only point of reference.

In this repo, the `[model](model)` folder contains the deep learning models, and the `[tools](tools)` folder contains various software tools used for the project.

More information on *Where in the World* can be found in our blog post series: *<links to come>*
