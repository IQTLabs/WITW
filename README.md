# Where in the World

The *Where in the World* (WITW) project has developed tools and capabilities for cross-view image geolocalization (CVIG).  CVIG is the process of matching a ground-level outdoor photograph to its location using overhead imagery of potential locations as the only point of reference.

In this repo, the [`model`](model) folder contains the deep learning model and instructions on how to run it, while the [`tools`](tools) folder contains various software tools used for the project.
